                <p>
                    Yuecheng graduated from Oberlin College in May 2023 with a degree in Neuroscience and Biology. At
                    Oberlin, she worked
                    with Dr. Tracie Paine on projects determining whether modulating the activity of PFC neurons in rats
                    affects their
                    timing behavior and received training in performing intra-cranial infusions and behavioral tasks.
                    She joined us in the
                    summer of 2023 as a research assistant and is currently working on mouse projects related to
                    age-related changes in
                    hippocampal neural population activity and their connection to emotionally salient information
                    encoding.</p>
