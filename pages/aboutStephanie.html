                <p>Stephanie is currently a Sophomore at Columbia University studying Neuroscience and Behavior.
                    She joined us Summer 2022 and is currently working with Gergely Turi on mouse projects surrounding
                    neurons in the hippocampus. She is curious and excited as this is her first experience in
                    neuroscience research.</p>
