                    <p>The main equipment in PIC is a <a href=https://www.bruker.com/products/fluorescence-microscopes/ultima-multiphoton-microscopy/ultima-investigator/overview.html target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruker Ultima</a> <i>in vivo</i> multiphoton microscope equipped with an <a href=https://www.spectra-physics.com/products/ultrafast-lasers/insight-x3 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insight X3</a> broadly tunable, ultrafast laser system. In addition to the multiphoton laser, two continuous-wave laser lines (473 and 561 nm) and a high-power LED (631 nm) are also coupled to the microscope, making it possible to conduct simultaneous imaging and photostimulation experiments using a wide range of inhibitory and excitatory photosensitive opsins.</p>
                    <p>High-speed volumetric scanning up to 400 Âµm is also possible with a Z-axis piezo drive.</p>
