                The lab is using mouse models to study the neuronal representation of learning and memory. More
                specifically, we are interested in how emotional memory traces are stored and recalled at the level of
                neuronal circuits in the hippocampus. To this end we use various imaging techniques, computer assisted
                image analysis and behavior assays.
