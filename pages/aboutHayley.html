            <h2>Hayley Judice</h2>
            <p>I'm entering my 3rd year at Hofstra University studying Neuroscience. I
                started volunteering at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in January
                2023 working with Gergely Turi on mice research which focus on
                mitochondrial activity in the hippocampus. Outside the lab I'm taking courses
                to become EMT certified and work as an EMT. I was thrilled to gain this
                opportunity, especially being a commuter, as I'm very interested in
                neuroscience research.</p>
