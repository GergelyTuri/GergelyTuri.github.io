                <h2>Novak (Haoyu) Chen</h2>
                <p>Novak is a Master's student in the Statistics program at the Graduate School of Arts and
                    Sciences, Columbia
                    University. He received his B.A. in Mathematics and Geographic Information Systems from Clark
                    University, but later he
                    cultivated a profound interest in psychology related areas. Currently, his research interests
                    revolve around using
                    quantitative methods to further his passion in psychology and neuroscience fields. He joined us in
                    Spring 2024 and
                    started working with Gergely Turi on behavioral consequences of stress-enhanced fear learning in
