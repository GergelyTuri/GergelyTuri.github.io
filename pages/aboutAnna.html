                <p>Anna is an incoming junior at Barnard College of Columbia University studying Neuroscience and
                    Behavior. She is joining
                    the team after being accepted into Barnardâ€™s SRI. She will be working with Dr. Turi to investigate
                    the effects of
                    psilocybin on BDNF growth factors. She is excited to dive into this topic and hopes to continue this
                    research through
                    her junior year.</p>
