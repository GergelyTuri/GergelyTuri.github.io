                <h2>Nicola Sheybani</h2>
                <p>Nikki studies neuroscience and behavior at Barnard College of Columbia University. She joined in Fall
                    2020 and has been working at our lab in conjunction with her senior thesis research. Since Nikki is
                    particularly interested in the behavioral facet of psychopathological disorders, she is
                    investigating how Early Life Stress can increase an individualâ€™s susceptibility to develop PTSD when
                    faced with severe stress later in life. </p>
